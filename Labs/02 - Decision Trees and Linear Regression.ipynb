The rules learnt for classification are easy for a person to follow, unlike the opaque \"black box\" of many other methods, such as neural networks. We demonstrate the utility of this using a German credit data set. You can read a description of this dataset at the [UCI site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29). The task is to predict whether a loan approval is good or bad credit risk based on 20 attributes.

Start with `n_estimators = 100`, use the `entropy` criterion and the same train/test split as before.
